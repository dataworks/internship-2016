# SmartHire

SmartHire is an open source applicant prioritization system powered by machine learning. The system was created to help organizations go through large backlogs of applicants and find the best candidates for their open positions. The system learns who the best candidates are based on who has previously made it through the hiring process. SmartHire is built on node.js, AngularJS, Elasticsearch, Apache Spark, Apache Tika, Apache OpenNLP and Scala.

**Built by the Data Works 2016 Summer Internship Team**
