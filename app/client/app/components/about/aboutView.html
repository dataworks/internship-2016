        <h2 class="page-header text-center">Our Goal</h2>
        <!-- <p class="text-center">At the start of the nine week internship program at Data Works, we were presented with a real life situation that we would solve by building a web application. Every year, Data Works receives hundreds of resumes for both the internship program and full time positions. Having to go through each individual resume to find the most qualified candidiates can be very tedious and time-consuming. </p>
        <p class="text-center">ResCheck is a web application reads in an uploaded resume and assigns a score based on the applicant's qualifications. After reviewing the applicant fully, an employer can then decide whether the applicant is a good fit for the company or not. We hope that this product will help an employer save time in the screening resumes and that it can improve the hiring process. </p> -->
        <p class="text-center">Data Works has choosen the five of us as interns to come in and try and improve on a real world process. This started as a way to help Data Works go through the hundreds of resumes that they recieve every year for the internship program, but we hope that we have created something that can do a little more than that.  The process of going through all the resumes that are submitted to any company is a long and tedious process, and sometimes in the end there are one or two amazing candidates.  Well we have come up with a way to cute this time down to almost nothing!</p>
        <p class="text-center">Over the period of nine weeks we have come up with an application that will make going through resumes and finding the best ones as simple as clicking a few buttons.  SmartHire will take in all of the resumes that a company recieves overtime, read through all of them, and assign each applicant a score.  This score is based on a machine learning algorithm that learns from the user of who is a good candidate for the company.  Using this score the user can easily get an idea of whether or not the individual would be a good fit for the company or not.  Along with the score our application will go through the resume and pull out the applicant's name, school, gpa, degree, contact info, skills, links, and current position to help give a brief look into the person.</p>
        <p class="text-center">To be more user-friendly we have also created some helpful options that will enhance the process.  There are different views that the user can look at starting off with the new view, and including favorites, review, and achive.  In order to put individual applicants into each view there are different buttons under the options column.  There are six different options in general favorite, review, archive, view resume, expand, and send back.  The first three option that display will have to do with the different applicant views and once click they will send that row from the table to whichever view was selected.  These options will be any three of either favorites, archive, review, or send back.  The send back button will send an applicant back to the new view.  If the user likes an applicant or wants to learn more about them they have two options either expand or view resume.  The expand option will expand the view on the table for the given applicant and it will show all of the applicants skills, more about their education, and any links were provided.  Another option is to click view resume which is connected to the applicants full resume that was submitted.</p>
        <p class="text-center">These past nine weeks have allowed us to learn so much and we have all come so far in our understandings of the different types of technologies that are used in the working world. We have used Spack, ElastiSearch, Apache Tika, Apache OpenNLP, MLlib, AWS S3/HDFS, Github API, LinkedIn API, GoogleMaps API, Node.js, Express, Bootstrap, Chart.js, Mocha and Chai for testing, and AngularJs.  To help with the tesing and deploying the application we have used Jenkins and we used Github to share/link all of our files, which allowed us to all work together.  We can not thank Data Works enough for this AMAZING opportunity.</p>
